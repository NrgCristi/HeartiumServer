1. Install NodeJS
2. Run "install_packages.bat" (This file isn't required after the packages are installed.)
3. Run "start.bat", It should say "Started listening on port 3551"
4. Use something to redirect the fortnite servers to localhost:3551 (Which could be fiddler, ssl bypass that redirects servers, etc...)
