Install Node.JS

Run "install_packages.bat" (This file isn't required after the packages are installed.)

Run "start.bat", It should say "Started listening on port 3551"

Use something to redirect the fortnite servers to localhost:3551 (Which could be fiddler, ssl bypass that redirects servers, etc...)
